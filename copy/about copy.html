                    <p class="description">In Shachaf Pereg's practice, she delves into the intricate interplay of sociological elements, often left unspoken, while striving to give a poetic interpretation of autobiographical narrative. Central to her exploration is the consideration of identity within the broader societal context, and the harmful compulsion of normative conventions that occurs in social frameworks. Conforming to social norms impacts individuals to assimilate into existing structures. She engages with the dynamics of compliance with authority and separation from social structures through compliance.</p>

                    <p class="description">These themes, which are sensitive because of their political tension, become approachable to address when taken out of their context. Pereg does so by seeking to illuminate contradictions with text or material, becoming a metaphor for phenomena such as conditioned behaviours and cultural codes. Creating sculptural installations and spatial and monumental presentations, she is changing and creating new arrangements of configurations, utilising games, tests, devices, and architectural elements. Through its tangible presence within the installation space, the work functions within the spatial context of presentation and hints at new realities.</p>
